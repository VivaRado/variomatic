**Initiator Maker**:

We initiate the instances by providing .glif format strings with 2D vector data. Our instances are divided into Source and Target instances, the Source is considered "gnostic" and the Target "agnostic", because in the Source, having a current_point, we can define our PSCA (Pre, Search Center and Ante points), making it gnostic, in contrast for Target we cannot define those points unless we proceed with creating a line with points matched by the PSCA, making Target agnostic.

**Main Function**:

When we have the initiated graphs for each instance (Source and Target), we can obtain a lengthwise list based on the graph center to node - edge length. As we essentially overlap the instances based on the graph center, the barycentric of the graph. This way we avoid iterating points based on their index in the shape as the vectors may have differentiation in point indexing.

We find the immediate points before and after the SC (Search Center), that is the point that we are currently iterating or the most distant point from the center (Outside to Inside). We manage to have a sPSCA for the gnostic or Source side, keeping in mind the circular nature of the sPSCA as it may overlap the line start/end.

Then we attempt to gather the agnostic side points that are at a specific radius from the sPSCA (Source PSCA). If there is nothing found in that radius we assume a "ghost point" and provide the coordinates of the P or A (Pre or Ante) points as matches as we rely on a minimum number of three points so we can identify matches.

We then plot the line on the Source making sure of the appropriate circular indexing where lines should not jump across the shape, and should actually be positioned exactly on the existing lines of the glif vectors.

Proceeding to the creation of the center transfer method that looks for Target points close to the sPSCA line and Source points - according to a perpendicular to the graph center and each sPSCA point, extended infinitely line - by further creating lines from those found target points found inside a radius of the sPSCA points, and sorting based on a created triangle that includes as points ( one: the current sPSCA point, two: the target point that we matched, three: the intersection of the infinite perpendicular line and the line extended from the target matched point), calculate that triangles surface area and we have best Target matches for each of the Source P, SC and Ante points.

Moving on to triangle comparison, we can now create the barycentric of the sPSCA (sPSCA_bar), evaluate the tPSCA triangles according to our rules, and start comparing and matching them to our sPSCA by overlapping them according to barycentric and comparing angles differences, edge lengths surface areas to obtain the best matching.

**Aggregate Line**:

We now know if P, SC or A is incorrect and create a new line by combining the other lines. This means that if by increasing radius to gather agnostic points in the target that do not properly create a line, we correct this by always getting 7 points, 3 points from each side of the most favorite to the SC, we do this by using our P and A points as observers, we also know if any of the P SC or A do not exist, we will use this to filter out a perfect agnostic line before triangulation. Now by perfecting triangulation we hope to be able to get 100% best matches in any shape that looks identical.
