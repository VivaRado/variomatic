Google Internationalization, abbreviated to the numeronyms i18n, includes Google Fonts that launched in 2010 to serve webfonts under open-source licenses, by 2016 is serving more than 800 webfont families.

In the context of making the web faster, on 14 September 2016, Adobe, Apple, Google, and Microsoft announced the technology of Variable Fonts, which allows a single font file to store a continuous range of design variants.

An approximation of size reduction, where a family of fonts is about 800kb, by serving a variable font that becomes 100kb, that is about 80% reduction. Let's just say that integrating the whole google fonts library of 800 families to variable format, will be as if google is just serving 100 families, the benefits to server loads and costs are not to be ignored.
