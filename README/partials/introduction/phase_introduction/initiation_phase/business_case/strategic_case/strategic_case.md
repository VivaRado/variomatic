Given the opportunities by the new format of variable fonts, Google has created tools like fontmake, that includes the varlib, in an attempt to merge compatible instances to variable fonts, effectively creating a paradigm. This enables Google Fonts to set the requirements for the next steps of managing the inconsistencies of those instances that are dubbed incompatible.

VivaRado has been tasked before in handling a case of manually updating an incompatible set of instances, to compatible variation capable instances that produced the new version of Advent font.

During that process VivaRado could identify the elements and conditions this could be possible effectively matching the strategic requirements of Google Fonts in delivering the new variable format, by minimising it's own footprint and server loads.
